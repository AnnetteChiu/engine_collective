#Recommendation System Practice â€” Chapter 6 Media Design Engine ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’— Movies Recommender System Content Based Recommender
#The recommender we built in the previous section suffers some severe limitations. 
#For one, it gives the same recommendation to everyone, regardless of the userâ€™s personal taste. If a person who loves romantic movies (and hates action) were to look at our Top 15 Chart, s/he wouldnâ€™t probably like most of the movies. If s/he were to go one step further and look at our charts by genre, s/he wouldnâ€™t still be getting the best recommendations.
