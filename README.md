#Recommendation System Practice â€” Chapter 6 Media Design Engine ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’— Movies Recommender System Content Based Recommender
#The recommender we built in the previous section suffers some severe limitations. 
#For one, it gives the same recommendation to everyone, regardless of the userâ€™s personal taste. If a person who loves romantic movies (and hates action) were to look at our Top 15 Chart, s/he wouldnâ€™t probably like most of the movies. If s/he were to go one step further and look at our charts by genre, s/he wouldnâ€™t still be getting the best recommendations.
#For instance, consider a person who loves Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, My Name is Khan and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham. One inference we can obtain is that the person loves the actor #Shahrukh Khan and the director Karan Johar. Even if s/he were to access the romance chart, s/he wouldnâ€™t find these as the top recommendations.

#To personalise our recommendations more, I am going to build an engine that computes similarity between movies based on certain metrics and suggests movies that are most similar to a #particular movie that a user liked. Since we will be using movie metadata (or content) to build this engine, this also known as Content Based Filtering.

#I will build two Content Based Recommenders based on:

#Movie Overviews and Taglines
#Movie Cast, Crew, Keywords and Genre
#Also, as mentioned in the introduction, I will be using a subset of all the movies available to us due to limiting computing power available to me.
